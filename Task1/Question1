Task 1
Peter's Journey to Solve City and Network Problems



Background:
Peter Parker is a computer science intern student working on a project in Stark industry.
Professor Bruce Banner has tasked Peter with solving real-world problems using Breadth-First
Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).



City Road Network - Finding Shortest Paths
Peter lives in a large city (Queens) with a complex road network. Their challenge is to help the
city's transportation department find the shortest routes from a central location to every other
important spot in the city. This is crucial for optimizing delivery routes for local businesses.



Problem:
The city's road intersections are nodes, and roads between intersections are edges. Peter
needs to use BFS and DFS to determine the shortest path from the central intersection to all
others and compare the both algorithms.


Peterâ€™s Plan:
- To calculate the shortest paths in the city road network.


Solving the City Road Network Problem with BFS & DFS
Peter models the city as a graph, where each intersection is a node and roads between
intersections are edges. The task is to find the shortest path from the city center (node 0) to 7,5
& 6 intersections.


Graph Input:
Peter should use the BFS and DFS approaches to find the most efficient routes for 7,5 & 6
intersections (edges).


Conclusion:
Through this project, Peter learned how to use BFS and DFS for different real-world
applications. BFS helped find the shortest paths in a city road network, while DFS was essential
for exploring the university's computer network for connectivity. They tested different scenarios,
from small to complex graphs, ensuring their algorithms worked efficiently
